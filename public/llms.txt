# RubyUI

> RubyUI is a UI component library for Ruby developers, built on top of Phlex, TailwindCSS, and Stimulus JS. Components are inspired by shadcn/ui and use compatible theming with CSS variables. Install via the ruby_ui gem into any Rails application. Components are written in pure Ruby using Phlex (up to 12x faster than ERB) and use custom Stimulus.js controllers for interactivity.
